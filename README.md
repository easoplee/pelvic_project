# Pelvic Region 3D MRI Scan Bone Segmentation

The objective of this project is to perform automatic multi-class bone segmentation on pelvic MRI dataset using deep learning models. Each pixel is assigned to one of the following classes.

Classes:

0. background
1. pelvic bone
2. femur
3. low spine bone
4. middle spine bone
5. top spine bone

## Segmenation Mask

Currently working on creating manual segmentation mask for bone segmentation project. The final segmented mask will be under the mask folder.

## Model

3D U-NET
